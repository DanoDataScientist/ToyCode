# ToyCode
[Random] Collection of Python code

This repo contains the code for creating a random sequence of numbers not yet drawn for Powerball. The original dataset was pulled from https://www.wilottery.com/lottogames/powerballhistoryOD.aspx and this was pulled on 10/25/18.

Feel free to use this to "inspire" your next selection of "lucky" numbers. Better than Quickpicks, I'd say!

The code is well commented, including areas you can modify to suit your taste. Note, in the initial lode of the dataset I wrote "your_path_here", adjust this to point to the data file on your local machine and it will run.

Good luck!
